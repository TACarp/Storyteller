    <p>This website is home to free and unlicensed storytelling work of Troy Augustus Carpenter. I make both original stories and fan-fiction of existing stories. The media format is text based literature. All stories are available as htmls or pdfs for free. You can view, download, print, post, and/or share them as you please, so long as you don't take credit for them.</p>
