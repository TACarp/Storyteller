    <p>This website is home to free and unlicensed storytelling work of Troy Augustus Carpenter. I make both original stories and fan-fiction of existing stories. The media format is text based literature, but video stories are on the way. All stories are available as downloadable PDFs or on YouTube for free. You can view, download, print, and/or share them as you please.</p>
