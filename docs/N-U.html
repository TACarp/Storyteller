            <h1>Ninjago: Unplugged</h1>
            <p>Ninjago: Unplugged is a LEGO Ninjago fan-fiction. It takes place when the Ninja are adults and is more gritty and mature than the animated series as it is aimed at teens and older rather than children. The ninja are adults now and married with children. Wu has since passed away from old age leaving the Ninja to their own elements to teach their children wisdom. There is an untold number of books, each consisting of ten chapters. The villains will be diverse and unique.</p>
