    <h1>World of Trithos</h1>
    <p>Trithos takes place in a North America Native American world untouched by Europe. It is about people called thoses, who have elemental abilities. A thos is either an ethos, logos, pathos, or a trithos.</p>
    <h2>The Primary Thoses</h2>
    <h3>Ethos</h3>
    <p><b>Form of Matter:</b> Gas</p>
    <p><b>Examples:</b> Air, Fire, Water Vapor, Smoke</p>
    <p>Those with ethos powers do the kind thing above the logical and self-serving thing. They consider many things sacred and not meant for human power over.</p>
    <h3>Logos</h3>
    <p><b>Form of Matter:</b> Liquid</p>
    <p><b>Examples:</b> Blood, Lava, Water</p>
    <p>Those with logos powers do the logical thing over the kind or self-serving thing. They are cold and calculating and personal relationships mean very little to them other than to serve a function. They don't mind spilling blood, so long as it makes sense.</p>
    <h3>Pathos</h3>
    <p><b>Form of Matter:</b> Solid</p>
    <p><b>Examples:</b> Stone, Wood, Ice</p>
    <p>Those with pathos powers do the self-serving thing rather than the kind or logical thing. They are dark and gritty and fueled by the empitness(es) of fear, guilt, shame, and/ or grief. They will follow their voids and doubt the existence of ethos.</p>
    <h2>Trithos</h2>
    <p><b>Forms of Matter:</b> Solid, Liquid, and Gas</p>
    <p><b>Examples:</b> All</p>
    <p>Trithoses struggle with finding the balance between the three thoses as they have a connection to all three motivations. They are extremely rare.</p>
