    <h1>World of Zodiacal</h1>
    <p>Zodiacal is centered around the Chinese Zodiac. There is a kingdom for each Zodiac. The royal families for each Zodiac Kingdom are known as Zodiacals and have Elemental Abilities. The king and queen of each Zodiac kingdom lead their kingdom from their capital. The princes and princesses of teenage age are expected to represent their kingdom at the Zodiac Council. The fortress for the Zodiac Council, The Round Fortress, is located in the City of the Heavens. The Zodiac Council's job is to resolve conflicts between the kingdoms with negotiation to spare them from warfare. This can be difficult as each Zodiac Kingdom is aligned with a specific political and/or spiritual philosophy. The estimated real-world Solar Calendar time period of the story is The Age of Reason. The world takes place in China as if it had gone through the Age of Reason.</p>
