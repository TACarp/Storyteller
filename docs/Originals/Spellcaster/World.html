            <h1>World of Spellcaster</h1>
            <h2>Setting</h2>
            <p>The world Spellcaster takes place in is called "Magicus." It takes place in a medieval Europe inspired world, but technology is modern. It is medieval because of the political structure of feudalism and lack of globalization. It is modern because of the technology and lifestyles. Spellcaster will be genre-bending between folk and pop culture.</p>
            <h2>Magic</h2>
            <p>Magic or Spellcasting, in Spellcaster is a soft magic system. Despite this, there are a few rules to limit the powers.</p>
            <h3>Requirments</h3>
            <p>There are five requirements for a spell to work. A given spell can have all, none, or any number of these requirments.</p>
            <h4>Who</h4>
            <p>Certain spells can only be cast by certain individuals. The spellcaster's personality and emotions determine if they can perform a spell. Magic will be used to externalize character development.</p>
            <h4>What</h4>
            <p>Certain spells require certain objects to work. Finding and protecting these objects serve as plot points.</p>
            <h4>Where</h4>
            <p>Certain spells can only be cast in certain locations. Conflicts are fought to possess these locations.</p>
            <h4>When</h4>
            <p>Certain spells can only be cast at certain times. These times are often determined by astronomy or historical importance. This creates time pressure for various camps.</p>
            <h4>Why</h4>
            <p>Certain spells can only be cast for certain reasons. If a spellcaster's motivation isn't what the spell requires, they cannot cast it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Spells are included to center around the plot, message, or themes of Spellcaster. Spells are not to be included for intrigue alone. There is no solid series spellbook, but guidelines are in place for the addition of spells.</p>
            <h2>Creatures</h2>
            <p>Generally, non-human sentiment creatures are not to be included. Spellcaster's plot, messages, and themes are represented in the spells. Spellcaster is not to show flaws or positive attributes of certain archetypes with creature symbols. While I like this method of symbolic storytelling in many stories, there is no long-term planning in Spellcaster centered around creature symbolism. This would make it unfruitful in literary value.</p>
            <h2>Character Groups</h2>
            <p>The nations of Magicus are small, single-province, kingdoms ruled by a royal family. Each one is named after an animal (i.e. lions, eagles, wolves, etc.) There is an unknown number of kingdoms; however, kingdoms will stop being added when the time comes every needed kingdom characteristics can be represented through an already included kingdom. The kingdoms fight with their neighbors from time to time and the warfare frequents medieval weapons with modern and sci-fi twists. Spellcasting is often also used in melees.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Spellcaster is meant to be a long-running series; therefore, staying true to its serie's bible is very important for it maintaining its cohesiveness. While there is very little long-term plot planning, Spellcaster will have methodical choices and feel like a sinlge unit.</p>
