    <h1>Legends of Naturu</h1>
    <p>Legends of Naturu is a story focused around seven tribes who each possess a given natural magic based on a primal desire. Each tribe has heroic and villainous moments in their many conflicts. It is safe for kids but may not be enjoyable due to writing sophistication and the lack of themes, such as comedy. The target audience is teens and adults. The main draw of the story is the complex moral nature of one's motivations. It will have an untold number of issues but stop once each tribe's legend is properly told.</p>
