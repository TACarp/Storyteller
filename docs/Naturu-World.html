    <h1>World of Naturu</h1>
    <p>Centuries ago the Islands of Naturu were unpopulated with humans. Then, humans shipwrecked on the New Zealand-sized hidden island chain. They each, in time, forgave their society given names and became named after animals. Examples of these names include Gray Wolf, Bald Eagle, White-Tailed Deer, etc. Naturu granted them magical abilities over nature. They formed into Seven Tribes based on which aspect of nature they had magic over. Each tribe has a primal desire which they represent.</p>
