        <h1>NEXO Knights: Resurrected</h1>
        <h2>Season 01: Sorcerer</h2>
        <h2>Episode 01: Darkness Falls</h2>
        <p>A fortress on tank treads that took a selfless four lanes of traffic on the outside but
            somehow had many large rooms on the inside proceeded along the holo-bridge. This was the
            Fortrex, mobile headquarters of the NEXO Knights. Their ride attracted a few interested
            passing glances of fans of the NEXO Knights. Inside the Fortrex, in the living room, the
            handsome Lance Richmond sat scrolling on his NEXO phone. He had chiseled features and a
            handsome jawline as well as hair the color of perfection that laid maintained and well kept on
            his head. Soon Clay Moorington entered the living room. Clay, while not handsome in the face,
            was more buff due to his intense training regimen. Clay had light brown hair that was gelled
            into being spiky. He asked his unrealistically selfish comrade at arms, “Lance, what are you
            doing? You have a run scheduled today and you are doing nothing right now.”</p>
        <p>Lance quipped, “Take that back. I never do nothing. Rest doesn’t make anyone rich and
            famous. I am going between my sixteen social media platforms. I have every major social
            media platform.”</p>
        <p>Clay responded, “You really need to exercise. Monstrox may be gone but we can’t count him
            out.”</p>
        <p>Monstrox was the warlock the NEXO Knights frequently battled with for the fate of Knighton.
            Lance argued, “Why would I exercise when I am rich enough to pay others to do physically
            demanding tasks for me?”</p>
        <p>Clay sighed at Lance’s unrealistic and de-energizing nature. Clay stated, “I am going to go take
            a nap. Resting makes warriors strong.”
        </p>
        <p>Clay reentered the hallway. There he found Aaron Fox. Aaron liked many awesome things. He
            had a freckled face and curly orange hair as well as a tiny soul-patch beard. Aaron stated,
            “Man, you look tired.”</p>
        <p>Clay replied, “Yeah. I was just running.”
        </p>
        <p>Aaron commended him by stating, “That is so go-terrific.”
        </p>
        <p>Clay added, “I am going to go chill now in bed.”
        </p>
        <p>Aaron replied, “I love a good nap-a-rue.”
        </p>
        <p>He then asked, “Is it true you are going out with Macy tonight?”
        </p>
        <p>Macy Halbert was Knighton’s Princess as well as one of their more useful knights. Clay
            answered, “Yeah, what of it?”</p>
        <p>Aaron commented, “Yeah, nothing. I think it’s so bodacious what you have with each other.
            Plus, I am a little surprised a partner has piqued your fancy.”
        </p>
        <p>Clay replied, “Relationships can mean a lot to have in your life, plus Macy is a fairly logical
            candidate.”</p>
        <p>Aaron stated, “Sweet.”
        </p>
        <p>Clay revealed, “But before that we volunteered at the Knights’ Academy.”</p>
        <p>The Knights’ Academy was the school in Knighton where future knights were trained in the
            many skillsets required to be a knight. Aaron replied, “Man, school is so dope, later bro.”</p>
        <p>Aaron entered the Roundtable Room. This was the room of the Fortrex where the knights
            would gather to make the hard decisions on next courses of action. It was also home of the
            NEXO supercomputer which was operated by a Junior Knight, Ava Prentice. Ava was years
            younger than most of the Knights. As a Junior Knight she was a student at the Knights’
            Academy, but due to a combination of luck and skill she was able to forego classroom training
            in favor of field training. This meant she worked on the Fortrex with the graduated Knights.
            She and fellow Junior Knight, Robin Underwood, had proven their prowess to such a degree in
            past conflicts that King of Knighton, Halbert, had reward them both Shields despite the fact
            neither had graduated the Academy. Shields were like badges in that they were the official
            statement of one’s belonging to the NEXO Knights. Ava was marks shorter than Aaron and her
            belt was so unnecessarily long for her size that she had to have it tucked into her pants. Aaron
            declared, “Did you hear? Clay and Macy are finally going out.”
        </p>
        <p>Ava sarcastically remarked, “Wow, congratulations. He doesn’t want to be lonely.”
        </p>
        <p>Aaron asked, “Don’t you ever want to have a partner?”
        </p>
        <p>Ava replied, “I don’t date unless it is a file naming convention. I have a higher purpose.”</p>
        <p>Aaron asked, “Is it true we’re on course toward the Knights’ Academy?”</p>
        <p>Ava replied, “Yeah, sad really. Clay finds so much confidence in what teachers think of him he
            thinks he has to show off his love of school even post-graduation. Sad really. Talk about poor
            self-esteem.”</p>
        <p>Aaron replied, “Nah, school was the best. What are you talking about?”
        </p>

        <p>Monstrox, in human form, was walking through the forest. The forest was a standard
            forest with trees and rocks that doesn’t require an explanation to be understood. By his side
            was the recently liberated Jestro. Jestro was a villain with a good heart and very poor taste in
            most things. He also was incredibly bad at many endeavors, including villainy, but he kept
            trying as being a great villain was his dream. Jestro complained, “I hate hiking. It is so scary
            being surrounded by all these trees and rocks.”</p>
        <p>Monstrox remarked, “Oh boy.”
        </p>
        <p>Jestro asked, “Why aren’t we taking the rolling HQ?”
        </p>
        <p>Monstrox replied, “It is called having a low profile. There is something to be said about not
            having the attention of everybody on the road. Those rule followers think I’m a failure and
            dead. I want to keep it that way.”</p>
        <p>Jestro requested, “Can you at least tell me where we are going?”
        </p>
        <p>Monstrox answered, “We are going to the Cave of Last Surrender.”
        </p>
        <p>Jestro asked, “Oh, what is in the Cave of Last Surrender?”</p>
        <p>Monstrox replied, “A Forbidden Power Merlok took from me centuries ago. I intend to use it
            again.”</p>
        <p>Merlok was a wizard friend of the NEXO Knights who recently entered the form of a robot as a
            he now exists as a digital entity as a result of a battle with Monstrox.</p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>Macy was a pretty princess with cute freckles on her face. Her dyed red hair was in a ponytail.
            She could best be described as sporty, energized, and adorable. She entered the living room of
            the Fortrex. Lance was present. Lance stated, “Macy, you mind leaving? I have a holo-phone
            call with Benjamin in a few minutes.”</p>
        <p>Macy asked, “Um, who’s Benjamin?”
        </p>
        <p>Lance replied, “Oh, he works at Holowood. Me and him are trying to put a show together.”
        </p>
        <p>Macy remarked, “Hopefully a beautiful show that is meaningful in many people’s lives.”
        </p>
        <p>Lance commented, “Ugh, that’s disgusting. That sounds like a lot of work. I want to work on
            something that makes me as rich and as famous with as little work as possible.”</p>
        <p>Macy sighed, “Oh, Lance.”
        </p>
        <p>Lance’s phone began to vibrate. Lance ordered, “Leave, my call is about to start.”
        </p>
        <p>Macy exited the living room and Lance answered his phone. A hologram of Benjamin, a tall and
            skinny man with sleek combed black hair appeared. Lance asked, “Have you looked over my
            portfolio?”</p>
        <p>Benjamin replied, “I have, and I think we can both agree, Richie, that beauty is overvalued by
            viewers.”</p>
        <p>Lance replied, “Finally, someone gets it. Glad we’re on the same page.”
        </p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>The Fortrex was now in Knightonia, the capital of Knighton. The small, well planned city
            was built inside a wall and around the Capitol Castle and Joustdome, which was the part of the
            city for large public gatherings. The Knights’ Academy was somewhere within this walled city.
            Clay, Aaron, Lance, Macy, and Axl were gathered on the roof of the Fortrex watching it
            approach the Academy. Axl was a large knight with a black mohawk and a monstrous appetite.
            Pork, poultry, beef, vegetables, fruit, and grain all fell victim to his digestive system without
            mercy. Soon Robin arrived from the staircase. Robin, like Ava, was marks shorter than the full
            knights. He had curly orange hair and short and thin arms and legs. He was very unwise and
            often made foolish choices. Aaron asked, “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you already be
            at the Knights’ Academy?”</p>
        <p>Robin replied, “Nah, I am missing school to help you today.”
        </p>
        <p>Clay asked, “Does Principal Brickland know that?”
        </p>
        <p>Principal Brickland was the Knights’ Academy’s principal. Before Robin could answer, the
            Fortrex arrived at the schoolyard. Brickland and many students exited the building for the yard
            as the NEXO Knights exited the Fortrex. Brickland took notice of Robin and declared, “Get to
            class, Underwood!"</p>
        <p>Robin replied “Right” before scurrying into the building. Lance was on his phone. Soon
            Brickland’s shadow entered his view. Lance stated, “Just letting my followers know where I
            am.”</p>
        <p>Brickland stated, “Get off the social media, Richmond. None of it is needed.”
        </p>
        <p>Lance pocketed his device and asked, “What pointless thing will you have us do today?”
        </p>
        <p>Brickland replied, “Meditation.”
        </p>
        <p>Aaron said, “Ah, I love meditation. It’s so dope.”
        </p>
        <p>Lance questioned, “Meditation, seriously? What fame has someone ever gotten from
            meditating?”
        </p>
        <p>Axl commented, “I love to meditate. Meditation makes my thoughts smarter.”
        </p>
        <p>Lance said, “Well, hopefully there will be tea at least.”
        </p>
        <p>Clay commented, “I am not much of a tea guy myself. I much prefer the health benefits of
            water.”</p>
        <p>Brickland commented, “There will be no tea at any school of mine. That evil drink causes too
            many problems.”</p>
        <p>Axl asked, “What problems can tea cause?”
        </p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>Monstrox held in his hand a stone tablet alongside Jestro in the Cave of Last Surrender.
            Inside that tablet contained a dark magical power. Jestro quizzed Monstrox by asking, “What
            does this Forbidden Power do?”</p>
        <p>Monstrox replied, “I am tired of being done wrong more than anyone in the history of the
            world by those rule following knights. This tablet contains the plague that ravaged Knighton
            centuries ago. That was until Merlok and Ned Knightly trapped it in this tablet. I am going to
            unleash it again. The people of Knighton deserve a plague and leaders they can’t trust. This will
            give them both in one fell swoop. And you will go down as one of the greatest, most despised,
            most feared villains ever.”
        </p>
        <p>Jestro replied, “Oh, goody. How I love being despised and feared.”
        </p>
        <p>Montrox declared, “It is time for the children of Knighton to remember how to fear.”
        </p>
        <p>He then picked up the tablet and smashed it against the stone cave floor. From it emerged a
            purple glowing cloud. Monstrox ordered, “Go. Go and attack the police forces of Knighton. If
            you succeed, I will let you infect whoever you want, including my arch enemies the NEXO
            Knights.”</p>
        <p>The purple cloud exited the cave.
        </p>
        <p>Monstrox commented, “Lucky for us, not so lucky for him, King Halbert is probably not ready
            for this. I feel so fortunate so many people will get to die because of us. Best of all, we will
            emerge as the new leaders, for only I know the cure and I’m not giving it up.”</p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>The Fortrex was lit up red, which the NEXO Knights had come to associate with danger.
            They soon all sat around the roundtable waiting for Ava’s report. Ava began, “A third of all
            police departments in the kingdom are reporting their officers have contracted the bubonic
            plague.”</p>
        <p>Axl stated, “That can’t be good.”
        </p>
        <p>Ava replied, “On the plus side, it should mean less police brutality.”
        </p>
        <p>Clay ordered, “Can you get King Halbert on the holo-phone? Maybe he foresaw such a problem
            could occur and had plans in place.”
        </p>
        <p>Ava reported, “Calling King Halbert now.”
        </p>
        <p>Soon King Eggred Halbert’s hologram appeared in the roundtable room. He had a grand
            orange beard and a fancy golden crown as well as blue and white robes. He reported, “Knights,
            I don’t know what to do. Our system, my system, isn’t prepared for this.”</p>
        <p>Clay asked, “Do you have anything you want us to do?”
        </p>
        <p>King Halbert ordered, “Find Montrox and stop him. Merlok has reason to believe he is
            responsible. He must be stopped.”</p>
        <p>Clay nodded his head in agreement.</p>
