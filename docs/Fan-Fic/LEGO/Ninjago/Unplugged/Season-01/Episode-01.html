        <h1>Ninjago: Unplugged</h1>
        <h2>Season 01: The Phantom Menace</h2>
        <h2>Episode 01: Trans-Oceanic Ninja</h2>
        <p>The sky was filled with stars over the shrine of Master Wu. Tourists had long since left
            and only the night watchman remained. Aziz had known the wise master only through stories,
            as Wu had died of old age a few years before his birth. Aziz’s father, Kai, knew Wu personally,
            and would speak of him as the wisest of sages. The cherry trees were in full bloom as Aziz
            raced across the courtyard of the shrine. Aziz was well trained in the ways of the ninja. He
            jumped up on the roof of the shrine and climbed in a window to the rafters. He traced the night
            watchman walking with a flashlight and found just the right time to enter the room with the
            tomb. Candles were lit in the room in remembrance of the master. Aziz thought as he
            approached the stone box with the master’s remains, “He couldn’t have been that wise.”</p>
        <p>Engraved on the casket was the symbol for creation, Wu’s element. He remembered his
            honorary Uncle, Lloyd, explain, “Wu once told me. Many people believe Wu’s powers of
            creation came from him. But, it came from dyad. Wu could not create without Garmadon’s
            destruction.” </p>
        <p>Aziz reached under his jumpsuit for the skeleton key on a chain the shop keeper had sold him.
            He took the necklace off and placed the key into an imaginary door before the casket. As if the
            rest of the room was a painting on a door, a door opened. Out from the door flew a ghost.
            Aziz fell back and dropped the key. The ghost was supposed to be Master Wu, instead it was
            somebody Aziz didn’t recognize. The ghost picked up the key and examined it. The ghost then
            asked, “Who are you? What am I doing here?”</p>
        <p>Aziz replied, “I am a ninja. You are here on accident; I was expecting someone else.” </p>
        <p>The ghost stated, “Very well then, I will be leaving now.”</p>
        <p>The ghost used the key to reopen the rift in the room. Aziz asked, “Wait, any chance I can have
            my key back?”</p>
        <p>The ghost replied, “Foolish young one. The key of Drewmore can only summon me,
            Drewmore. You have no use for it.” </p>
        <p>Aziz confused, stated, “But the shopkeeper told me that it would allow me to speak to the
            Master of Creation.”</p>
        <p>Drewmore replied, “You were expecting a different Master of Creation?”</p>
        <p>Aziz answered, “Yes, Ninja Master Wu.” </p>
        <p>Drewmore spat, “Wu, that failure of a creator! Overrated in my book.” </p>
        <p>Aziz asked, “How was Wu overrated?” </p>
        <p>Drewmore answered, “You see, Wu was of a dyad with his brother. Being a dyad makes him
            weak. His ability to create was tied to his brother’s ability to destroy. Most Masters of Creation
            and I can create without anything needing to be destroyed.” </p>
        <p>Aziz asked, “Wait, how many Masters of Creation are there? I thought it was extremely rare.”</p>
        <p>Drewmore replied, “There are hundreds of us. But you see we are prisoners.” </p>
        <p>Aziz asked, “Prisoners?” </p>
        <p>Drewmore added, “Yes, the other dragons and I left to convince the First Spinjitzu Master to
            come back to the First Realm. The Oni felt threatened by our plan, so, they imprisoned us so
            we would not succeed. It is a great crime of history that far too many don’t care about.”</p>
        <p>Aziz sated, “I don’t understand. You are with me right now.”</p>
        <p>Drewmore answered, “This is merely a projection of my soul. My body and my army’s bodies
            are being held on the Dark Island.” </p>
        <p>Aziz asked, “Is there any way I can help?”</p>
        <p>Drewmore extended out his hand with the key and answered, “Take this key to the Dark Island.
            The grooves in the key line up with a mountain range. Find the cave in the mountain range and
            use the key inside and we will be free.” </p>
        <p>Aziz replied, “I promise. I will do what’s right.” </p>
        <p>Drewmore responded by saying, “Thank-you.” </p>
        <p>He then faded away. Aziz heard the footsteps of the approaching watchman. He disappeared
            into the rafters before the watchman entered.</p>

        <p>Andes circled around the robotic dummy. Two wooden boards went flying toward him.
            He karate chopped both before doing a somersault off the wall to avoid shurikens. His father,
            Lloyd, sipped some tea while watching. Andy finished the course and bowed to his father.
            Lloyd raised a brow, surprised he was done. A punching bag swung down from the ceiling on a
            chain and knocked the bowing Andy off the floor. JJ, Jay and Nya’s son, complained, “You
            aren’t allowed to change the course.”</p>
        <p>Kai stepped out of the kitchen and replied, “Change is life itself.”</p>
        <p>Lloyd sipped more tea and commanded, “Andes, go through it again, and this time, don’t
            expect any charity. The training course reflects the fact that villains don’t play by any rules.”
        </p>
        <p>The doorbell started ringing. Kai stated, “That is probably Anissa, Andy should get it.”
        </p>
        <p>JJ asked, “How do you know these things?”
        </p>
        <p>Andy opened the door. Standing on the doorstep, as Kai predicted, was Anissa, a friend of
            Andy’s. Anissa wore black sweatpants and a bright pink tank top. She had short and shaggy
            black hair that fell only a few inches. Andy asked, “What are you doing here?”</p>
        <p>Anissa entered as she squeaked, “You can’t just text me that you are setting sail for across the
            ocean without us meeting one last time first.”</p>
        <p>Andy replied, “Oh, sorry. None of my other friends have come by.”
        </p>
        <p>Anissa asked, “Do you want to go out for ice cream or something?”
        </p>
        <p>Andy answered, “No, lots of training to be done for this mission.”
        </p>
        <p>Anissa, in her high pitch voice, squeaked, “Forget it.”
        </p>
        <p>She turned away and exited. Andy called after her, “Anissa!”</p>
        <p>Andy closed the door and looked at his mentors and colleagues. Kai stated, “Awkward.”
        </p>
        <p>JJ was looking down at his foot as he twisted it on its toes. Andy stated, “What? There are
            more important things I have to do than having a girlfriend.”</p>
        <p>Lloyd advised, “You will need a partner in your life, or the hurt will be too much. A man is not
            invincible.”</p>
        <p>Andy stated, “I am the future Green Ninja. Girls aren’t what is important with the all the threats
            to Ninjago.”</p>
        <p>Jay, the best ninja beyond a shadow of a doubt, stated, “Just because you have a partner
            doesn’t mean you can’t do what needs to be done. You do not have to choose one or the other.
            They can be inclusive to each other.”</p>
        <p>Andy argued, “What happens when I’m going through a breakup at a crucial moment in
            Ninjago history?”
        </p>
        <p>Minerva, Zane and Pixal’s, daughter argued, “From what I have observed relationships seem to
            inflict no damage.”</p>
        <p>Zane argued, “That seems really incorrect. It would be unreasonable to think any relationship
            wouldn’t have its painful moments.”</p>
        <p>Jay added, “But they are worth it in the end.”
        </p>
        <p>Andy stated, “You guys are impossible.”</p>
        <p>He soon resumed his training</p>
