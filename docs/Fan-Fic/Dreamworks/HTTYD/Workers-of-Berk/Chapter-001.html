        <h1>How to Train You Dragon: Workers of Berk</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 001: Funut</h2>
        <p>The Isle of Berk sat with crashing ocean waves against the jagged cliffs. At the top of
            the cliff stood a towering man. If the giant statues in the water didn’t scare away would-be
            invaders, this man’s stature would. He was fit and muscular. He resembled a Rumblehorn or a
            Crimson Goregutter, two dragons that being at odds with would be lethal. No chief of Berk to
            this point had been so feared, or so loved. This was Stoick the Vast. He stood on the cliffs
            looking over the ocean with a look of grandeur. A large wave crashed against the cliffs below.
            A Deadly Nadder with a human on her back landed behind him. On Berk, dragons were never
            killed by Vikings. The Vikings of Berk saw dragons not as just animals, but as the source of
            light in the universe. The girl riding the blue dragon was Astrid. She was loved throughout Berk
            for her beauty and the prize of many of the boys her age. Never before had one been so much
            a Viking as Astrid. She embodied the nobility of what Vikings stood for. The sixteen-year-old
            dismounted her Deadly Nadder, Stormfly, and approached the mighty chief.
            Stoick didn’t even take a glance at her as he spoke in a barely decipherable mumble, “No sign
            of him?</p>
        <p>Astrid reported, “Bucket thinks he saw him fly off to the east.”</p>
        <p>Stoick turned to Astrid to make his point, as he commanded, like a prison warden who lost his
            most dangerous criminal, “Bring him back.”</p>
        <p>Astrid mounted Stormfly and ascended into the sky. Stoick looked bitter as she flew west.</p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>Gentle waves lapped pristine golden sand in front of a forest. Trees began moving in the forest
            as if a Screaming Death were chopping through the forest like a saw through butter. A metal
            leg emerged from the forest; this Viking had survived a dangerous situation or two. Attached
            to the metal leg was a small boy who hopelessly was swatting flies away. He had ruffled
            auburn hair, that many considered brown, and cutting green eyes. He tripped over a log with
            his metal leg and landed in the sand. From the woods next emerged a dragon! The dragon
            flipped Hiccup over and stared int his eyes. The dragon soon began furiously licking Hiccup.
            Hiccup commended, “Who’s a good boy, who’s a good boy.”</p>
        <p>The dragon began wagging his tail like a friendly dog who had just gone through a joyous
            reunion. The dragon was a Night Fury. The Night Fury was the greatest dragon of them all.
            Fastest dragon in the sky, smartest dragon alive, and master of the great plasma blast. Night
            Furies were seen as a death sentence to be in the presence of, before Berkians and dragons
            became bonded as the closest of animals. The Night Fury, Toothless, picked up Hiccup and
            placed him on his feet, then patted him on his head. Toothless gave an awkward smile, like he
            was pleased he had put things back in order. Hiccup wasn’t looking at Toothless, instead he
            was looking at something in the sky. Toothless turned his head to gaze at the approaching
            dragon. Hiccup dove behind one of the many rocks that scattered the beach. Toothless, in suit,
            dove behind the same rock, with much less success at being hidden. Hiccup turned his head
            with annoyance at Toothless. Toothless smiled and blushed. Hiccup rolled his eyes and drew a
            monoscope from his satchel. He soon got a good look at the approaching dragon. He
            murmured, “Oh great, she found me faster this time.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup then took a little bit longer to take in the dragon and rider. It wasn’t Deadly Nadder
            being ridden by a smart girl, it was a Monstrous Nightmare being ridden by a dunce. Hiccup
            asked, “Snotlout?”</p>
        <p>Toothless shrugged. The Monstrous Nightmare, Hookfang, flew over the heads of Hiccup and
            Toothless and Snotlout, the rider, hadn’t even noticed them. The rider and dragon soon
            disappeared down the coast. Hiccup sighed and proclaimed, “I think it is safe to come out of
            our less than functional hiding spot now.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup lifted his face over the side of the rock to see a pretty girl’s face. He jumped back in
            shock. He hadn’t even noticed Astrid approaching. Toothless caught Hiccup and propped him
            up to Astrid. Astrid stated, “I would ask what you’re doing here, but I already know.” She then
            asked, “Avoiding your dad?”</p>
        <p>Hiccup asked, “How did you find me?”</p>
        <p>Astrid replied, “Well, when I learned you did a direct pass over Berk heading east, it was pretty
            obvious you were going to turn around, once out of sight, and head west.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup replied, “Fine, you caught me. Is he mad?”</p>
        <p>Astrid remarked, “You would expect otherwise?”</p>
        <p>A voice soon entered behind Hiccup which asked, “What are you doing on my rock?”</p>
        <p>Hiccup turned around to see Tuffnut dismount his Hideous Zippleback, Barf and Belch. Tuffnut
            drew his mace and decreed, “I have a mace and I know how to use it!”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut’s twin sister, Ruffnut popped out from behind the other head of Barf and Belch and
            added, “He really does know how to use it. He is more efficient at making perfectly functional
            things non-functional than any one I have ever meet.”</p>
        <p>Astrid asked, “What are you two doing here?”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut replied, “Better question would be what are you two doing here next to our rock.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup, in disbelief, asked, “You own a rock?”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “Yup, just bought it from Trader Johann, along with this beach. So, get off my
            rock or you’ll replace Gobber as the Berkian with the most injuries.”</p>
        <p>Astrid stepped off the rock and decreed, “Fine, you can have your rock if you want it that
            much! It’s just a rock!”</p>
        <p>Hiccup asked, “How did you two afford a beach?”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “We just cracked into our retirement fund.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup asked, “How do you have a retirement fund? You haven’t even started working.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “Who needs to work when you can just get rich without working?”</p>
        <p>Astrid sarcastically asked, “How did you two geniuses pull that off?”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “Well, remember that time we went searching for that treasure so Hiccup
            could prove himself to his father yadda, yadda. And the treasure became buried
            underground.”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut finished, “We dug it up.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup stated, “Guys, I thought we agreed that was too dangerous to try to dig it up.”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut declared, “Maybe too dangerous for you guys, not to Thorstons.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “You see, we Thorstons value human life very little and value gold much
            more.”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut added, “So at any rate we dug up all the gold and are now spending it on our
            retirement.”</p>
        <p>Astrid argued, “You do realize you didn’t earn any of that gold.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut, “So, make your point.”</p>
        <p>Astrid asked, “What do you need to retire from? You don’t even work.”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut replied, “It’s a win-win. We Thorstons have very short life spans.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut added, “Yeah, I can invent five whole family members who died young, maybe even
            six. At any rate, we have to spend this money. Can you imagine how awful it would be if our
            money outlived us?”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut replied, “Ugh, I hate to even think of all the wild parties we would have forgone.”</p>
        <p>Soon, Hookfang and Snotlout landed next to Barf and Belch. Snotlout stated, “Man, you guys
            are hard to find. You should really put up a house number.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut ordered, “Add that to the list. Paint the house number in the largest lettering possible.
            And also, make sure the mailbox is on our side of the street. We don’t want to have any
            delivery people getting lost.”</p>
        <p>Astrid asked Snotlout, “What are you doing here?”</p>
        <p>Snotlout replied, “When I heard about the twins’ great idea, I decided to get into the
            construction business.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup replied, “That’s great, but don’t you think you should take classes in construction or be
            an apprentice at it first?”</p>
        <p>Snotlout replied, “How hard can building a house be? I don’t need some dumb education to be
            smart. I was born smart.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup saddled Toothless. He then said to Astrid, “Well, I have to face my dad eventually. Can
            you make sure Snotlout doesn’t build anything too dangerous for the twins?”</p>
        <p>Astrid replied, “No promises.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup remarked, “Yeah, well that’s great. I will send Fishlegs to take your place.” He then
            turned to Toothless and said, “Come on bud.”</p>
        <p>Toothless shot into the sky.</p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>Toothless landed in Berk to find Stoick in the town plaza with his arms crossed. Stoick stated,
            “Well.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup replied, “Yeah, I’m sorry I flew off- again.”</p>
        <p>Stoick replied, “Maybe instead of keep apologizing you could stop doing it. That would go
            much further in earning back my trust.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup reported, “Anyway, I just want to make sure you are aware the twins have dug up
            Hamish the Second’s treasure.”</p>
        <p>Stoick outraged cried, “They what?”</p>
        <p>Hiccup replied, “I think I was pretty clear. They went to where Hamish the Second’s treasure
            was buried and dug it out.”</p>
        <p>Stoick angrily spat, “That’s our treasure. It belonged to our ancestors. It belongs to us. The
            twins didn’t earn it.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup justified, “Well, technically, neither did we. We just inherited it.”</p>
        <p>Stoick insisted, “Our ancestors worked for it for their descendants to have. They earned it for
            us.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup argued, “But we didn’t earn it, we just inherited it. I can’t take it from the twins, they are
            my friends.”</p>
        <p>Stoick replied, “We may not have earned it, but according to the laws of Berk, it is ours. You
            need to ask yourself, what’s more important, looking selfless or upholding the laws of the land.
            Plus, I could use a bigger bedroom.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup remarked, “Yup, that’s real selfless.”</p>
        <p>Stoick instructed, “Ride to the twins and tell them to give the money they dug up back to its
            rightful owners- us.”</p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>Snotlout was using Hookfang’s claws to push sand into a pile. Astrid remarked, “Snotlout, you
            can’t just push sand into a pile and call it a foundation.”</p>
        <p>Snotlout argued, “We all have different ways of doing things. You just need to accept everyone
            doesn’t have to be like you.”</p>
        <p>Astrid remarked, “There is no way this is going to hold.”</p>
        <p>Soon Fishlegs, riding Meatlug, landed next to Astrid. Astrid begged, “Please take my spot
            babysitting Snotlout.”</p>
        <p>Snotlout spat, “I heard that.”</p>
        <p>Fishlegs replied, “What makes you think I would enjoy that more than you?”</p>
        <p>Astrid twisted Fishleg’s hand back. Fishlegs yelped, “Fine, I’ll watch him.”</p>
        <p>Astrid mounted Stormfly and they soon ascended into the sky. Fishlegs turned to Snotlout and
            asked, “What are you doing?”</p>
        <p>Snotlout replied, “My new business, construction.”</p>
        <p>Fishlegs replied, “Snotlout, you can’t just wake up one morning and decide to start your own
            construction business. You need to work in an industry for at least thirty years before you can
            own your own a business in the same industry.”</p>
        <p>Snotlout replied, “Oh, please! You spend all day reading books. How would you know how the
            world works?”</p>
        <section class="Transition"></section>
        <p>Tuffnut and Ruffnut stood on the heads of Barf and Belch in the forest. They soon swung
            around. Tuffnut asked, “Are we right-side up, or is the world right-side up?”</p>
        <p>A voice from behind them answered, “Both actually.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “Well, that’s a first. Everything is in its logical orientation. We must be doing
            something wrong.”</p>
        <p>They turned around to see Hiccup. Hiccup asked, “What are you guys up to?”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “We are looking for where to have the yak races.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup remarked, “Yeah, that’s great.” He then said, “About the money you dug up, my dad is
            upset. He said he is going to give you the opportunity to give it back. Before…”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut asked, “Before what?”</p>
        <p>Hiccup relied, “Before he puts you in jail for stealing it if you don’t return it.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut remarked, “What, we stole this money fair and square. How dare he challenge the
            richest people in town.”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut added, “I know. He has too much courage. Why would anyone want that quality in
            their leader?”</p>
        <p>Hiccup asked, “Anyway, are you going to give it back?”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut and Ruffnut looked at each other. Tuffnut said, “Give us a moment to discuss.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut and Ruffnut started whispering to each other. Hiccup thought he heard chicken noises
            coming from their mouths. Soon they emerged from the frenzied whispering. Tuffnut
            declared, “We will give the gold back so long as we get to be twins.”</p>
        <p>Ruffnut added, “Identical twins.”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut explained, “We are like family to each other.”</p>
        <p>Hiccup asked, “Yeah, you already are, but whatever. Thank you. No hard feelings?”</p>
        <p>Tuffnut replied, “Hiccup, life is too short for hard feelings. I mean we are probably going to
            spend all of eternity together in Valhalla, so I’ll just start being mad at you then. It will give me
            way more time to be mad at you.”</p>
